# CPP Neural Net

## Goal
Aim of this project is to create a library similar to PyTorch which will allow us to easily design and train neural net models. 
Through this project, we aim to uderstand the core ideas of neural nets and challenge ourselves in implementing those concepts in c++ from scratch. 

## File Organizations
We will build a self-contained library located inside ./src/CPPNeralNet
```
/include

+ /CPPNeuralNet

/src
